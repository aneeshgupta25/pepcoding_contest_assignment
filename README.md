# pepcoding_contest_assignment

I am Aneesh Gupta, an NSUT(CSE) 1st year student. I recently got admission and my college is yet to start.
I have been using PEPCODING as a platform to become efficient in DSA. Currently I am on level 2. 

Web Dev was completely new to me but I wanted to participate in this contest. So, I referred Jasbir bhaiya's lectures on web scrapping and gave my attempt. Would request you to refer the code files and output screenshots in the repository.
